1. 15-20 mins per plot so it can be continued if necessary
2. create set of services

questions:
- finally, how many services in scan list?
	- manageable set of services to study
	- depends on how much time you have to scan
	- potentially 100
- next steps?
	- scan tranco with each 'popular' service from above
	- final scan should collect:
		- dnssec info (validator flag)
	- do authoritative servers for domains:
		a) what are they?
		b) do they support some type of encrypted dns
			- not currently implemented
		- dns over quikk
	- collect correlation between security for service-advertising domains and domains with no services?
	- do handshake with each of these services to understand:
		- authentication
		- is using tls
		- save cert
		- is it requesting cert from me
		- cert validity
		- does it try to upgrade handshake security (eg smtp -> tls)
	- examination of txt records
	- look into zgrab tool (zmap.io)
		- potentially extend
